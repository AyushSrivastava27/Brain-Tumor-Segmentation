### Fine-Tuning Deep Learning Models for Multimodal Brain Tumors

- **Implemented Deep Learning and Transfer Learning by fine-tuning and comparing EfficientNetB0, ResNet50V2, InceptionV3,
and DenseNet121**

- **Performed various experiments to determine the best model using matrices like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
